									<h3 class="bld">Mentorship</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>Mentorship is an academic support provided to students facing difficulties 
										in their learning, aiming to enhance their academic outcomes. This mentorship 
										program is affiliated with Binus University, particularly within the Student 
										Advisory and Support Center (SASC) division. Mentorship is not only focused on 
										academic aspects but also encompasses personal guidance and skill development. 
										I am involved in this program as a mentor, providing support and sharing experiences 
										and knowledge to help students achieve their best academic and personal potential.</p>
									<p>Through participating in mentorship, I obtained a scholarship that helped alleviate 
										financial burdens during my studies and boosted my motivation to fulfill my 
										responsibilities as a mentor.</p>
								</ul>
								<h3 class="bld">Hobbies</h3>
								<ul>
									<li class="bld">Taekwondo</li>
									<p>Taekwondo is a traditional martial art originating from Korea. Known for its 
										combination of hand and foot techniques, as well as structured attack and 
										defense movements. The primary goal of Taekwondo is to develop physical, 
										mental, and moral strength while practicing high ethics and discipline. In 
										competitions, points are awarded for accurate and effective techniques against 
										opponents. Taekwondo is also often regarded as a beneficial form of exercise 
										to improve flexibility and balance</p>
									<p>In Taekwondo, I have achieved the rank of Red Stripe Black Belt One. I have been 
										practicing Taekwondo since 2018 until now. Through my participation in Taekwondo, 
										I have gained numerous benefits such as enhancing emotional control, patience, clear 
										thinking, and more.</p>
									<li class="bld">Badminton</li>
									<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two 
										pairs of players (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular 
										court divided by a net. Players use a shuttlecock, a feathered or plastic projectile, 
										aiming to score points by landing it in the opponent's side of the court. The game requires 
										quick reflexes, agility, and strategic thinking. Badminton is played both recreationally and 
										competitively and is a popular sport worldwide.</p>
									<p>I enjoy playing badminton because it helps improve agility, reflexes, cardiovascular health, 
										and overall physical fitness. Playing badminton also serves as a stress-reliever, providing 
										a break from the routine of daily life.</p>
