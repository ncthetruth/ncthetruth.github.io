								<h3>Why do we conduct research on this topic ?</h3>
								<p class="pmid">In modern society, particularly in the banking sector, credit cards 
									have become a widely used payment tool. They offer convenience for 
									transactions but require users to pay their outstanding balances monthly. 
									However, the convenience of credit cards is countered by the risk of credit 
									card fraud, including carding, where attackers steal user information to 
									make unauthorized transactions. In 2021, there were 389,737 reported cases 
									of credit card fraud globally, resulting in losses of $32.34 billion. To 
									address this issue, this research explores the effectiveness of various 
									methods, including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support 
									Vector Machines (SVM), and Ensemble Methods, to classify and detect 
									potentially fraudulent transactions, ultimately contributing to improved 
									credit card fraud detection models.</p>
								<h3>What do we do ?</h3>
								<p>We combined two types of algorithms, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Logistic 
									Regression, SVM and Random Forest, and Random Forest and Logistic Regression. 
									We used data from Kaggle, which contained one million rows, and split it into 
									75% for training data and 25% for testing data. We also utilized the scikit-learn library. 
									To combine these two algorithms, we employed Ensemble Learning, a method where we leveraged 
									two different algorithms and conducted a voting process on their results. This concept is 
									similar to Random Forest, but with the distinction that we used different algorithms, 
									making it a heterogeneous ensemble approach.</p>
								<h3>What were the results ?</h3>
								<p>Based on the experiments conducted, SVM and Random Forest proved to be the most effective 
									combination of algorithms. This combination exhibited the highest accuracy performance, 
									with precision at 100%, recall at 99%, F-Measure at 99%, and an overall accuracy rate of 100%. 
									These results highlight that employing a voting mechanism to create a hybrid model can 
									significantly enhance the accuracy and performance of base classifier models. This approach 
									also opens up possibilities for using different combinations of base classifier methods to 
									create more efficient and faster credit card fraud detection models.
									Our work demonstrates that combining algorithms, such as SVM and Random Forest, can achieve 
									the highest accuracy. In future studies, we plan to explore the utilization of real-time credit 
									card transaction data for fraud detection. This research aims to enhance the effectiveness of 
									fraud detection algorithms by leveraging ensemble classifier methods and developing more refined 
									algorithms tailored to credit card fraud cases. The ultimate goal is to improve the overall 
									efficiency of credit card fraud detection systems.</p>
