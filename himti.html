								<p class="pmid">HIMTI is a student association of computer science tasked with unifying 
									and developing all computer science students at Bina Nusantara University to make HIMTI 
									BINUS University known as a student association recognized throughout Southeast Asia by 
									2025. It aims to strengthen the bonds among HIMTI family members through knowledge, 
									experience, and values, forming a solid HIMTI family. The organization seeks to instill 
									and develop a professional attitude in each individual within HIMTI, preparing them to 
									face the challenges of the industrial world, careers, and global environmental development. 
									Additionally, HIMTI upholds a strong sense of nationalism, demonstrating its commitment to

									<h3 class="bld">Activities Performed</h3>
								<ul>
									<li class="bld">HIMTI LDKP 2023</li>
									<p class="pmid">HIMTI LDKP 2023 is an inter-student organization event designed to provide 
										training on leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. The objective of HIMTI LDKP 
										2023 is not only to impart essential skills but also to strengthen the bond among its members. 
										The event includes activities such as focus group discussions aimed at sharpening critical 
										thinking, dealing with diverse perspectives, defending arguments, and enhancing public speaking abilities.</p>
									<p class="pmid">I served dual roles as a member of the DnD team and as the PIC. In the DnD capacity, my responsibilities 
										included generating ideas and presenting them to HIMTI members, evaluating their suitability to meet the needs of 
										HIMTI LDKP 2023. Additionally, I undertook the documentation of all activities throughout the HIMTI LDKP 2023 
										event. In my role as PIC, I led the HIMTI Region Alam Sutra members, ensuring the smooth and orderly progression 
										of the event, culminating in its successful completion.</p>
									<li class="bld">TECHNO 2022</li>
									<p class="pmid">HIMTI Techno 2022 is a welcoming party for freshmen in the computer science department at 
										Binus University. During this event, freshmen are equipped with introductory materials 
										before starting their lectures, such as programming with C. The program also includes 
										various performances from student organizations, such as dance and band performances. 
										This not only provides a more in-depth insight into computer science studies at Binus 
										University but also strengthens the sense of community among computer science students.</p>
									<p class="pmid">In the HIMTI Techno 2022 event, I was assigned to Division 3, known as DnD, which stands 
										for Design and Development. My role involved generating ideas and presenting my proposed 
										concepts to all Techno 2022 members before implementing them into the final product to 
										contribute to the success of the Techno 2023 event.In addition to my creative contributions 
										within the DnD division, this experience provided me with valuable insights into presentation 
										skills, public speaking, and effective communication in a team setting. Dealing with various 
										aspects of ideation and implementation enhanced my abilities in project management and 
										collaboration.</p>

									</ul>
									<li class="bld">Other Design</li>
									<ul class="pmid">I was involved in designing the Instagram feed for HIMTI Binus University's 
										mascot named Tibot. My responsibilities included ideation, where I searched for concepts 
										and presented design ideas for the mascot's feed. Subsequently, I executed the design and, 
										in the end, posted it on HIMTI's Instagram account.</ul>
									<ul class="pmid">I was responsible for designing the YouTube thumbnail for HIMTI with a theme 
										focused on responsive learning before the final semester exams. I opted for a minimalist 
										design to ensure easy visibility and understanding, allowing viewers to quickly grasp the 
										video's content just by looking at the thumbnail.</ul>
									<ul class="pmid"></ul>
								</ul>
								<h3 class="bld">What do i get ?</h3>
								<p class="pmid">Participating in the activities of the Computer Science Student Association at Binus University 
									has taught me numerous valuable lessons. It provided insights into leadership, guiding me on how 
									to be a good and effective leader. Additionally, I learned the art of presenting a product and 
									making sound agreements. The experience also honed my critical thinking skills, encouraged quick 
									thinking, and emphasized the importance of staying updated on changes and emerging trends. Furthermore, the association taught me the dynamics of teamwork and how to be a positive 
									influence as a team member. It also equipped me with the skills to speak confidently in front of a large 
									audience. I am immensely grateful to HIMTI for imparting these invaluable lessons and enhancing many of 
									my abilities.</p>
